      "Really fast shipping option was great because I broke my phone. The phone is in excellent condition as described. The screen has one needle pin scratch (literally a teeny tiny dot that is less than a speck of dust) and one scratch that’s less than a mm, which is incredible. I expect some wear and tear, but it is way better than my expectations and experience buying refurbished phones. I’m very pleased. It’s as described if not better. I will be purchasing from this seller again. Great prices and reviews on their page by the way. Works like brand new and it has 86% battery life. Came with a charger box and a chord, very nice of them to include both with the amazing deal it was already at. I would recommend anyone to buy a phone from here and am eyeing another now for family. Thank you so much seller!

      "I can hardly believe this phone is refurbished - it seems brand new. I haven't bought refurbished electronics before.I usually hang on to my phones until they quit working and then buy a new one from the wireless provider, but this time I wanted an unlocked phone. It looks new and functions perfectly, and was very reasonably priced for an unlocked phone that will allow me to change wireless providers. Setting up the esim card was a bit complicated for me; I think it's easy to think something isn't working at first. Maybe it depends on your wireless provider, though. I had my tech-savvy daughter help me with the set-up, and it works great.

      "I have had this iPhone for 38 days.It has the worst battery life of any iPhone I've ever owned, and I have owned ONLY iPhones since the first version was released 17 years ago.This is the second iPhone 14 that I've bought from the renewed store .The first one I bought on December 4th, 2023, and I could not have been happier with the phone.It arrived in brand new condition, and performed flawlessly.On the recommendation of a friend, I checked the battery health and charging after having it for MONTHS and it was at 100%! I was thrilled!I absolutely loved the phone!I never had a single problem with it.Unfortunately, on July 30 of this year I dropped it, and it was beyond repair.I immediately went back to the Amazon renewed store and purchased another iPhone 14 because my experience with the first one was so fantastic.It arrived in new looking condition, exactly like the one I bought in December 2023.It was not scratched or anything really noticeable, it just seemed to be \"worn\" a little bit, but I fully understood that it was a renewed phone, and any cosmetic issues were not that important to me, including the color, which, when my iPhone is in its case, you cannot tell what color it is anyway.Unfortunately, I DID NOT look at the battery health and charging when I first got the phone 38 days ago, but I did look at it about two weeks ago, and it said 93%.I thought, ok, it's a renewed phone, it's not going to have 100% battery life.I can live with that.Well, I just looked at it today and it's now at 90% battery health and charging.So this phone is dying quickly.After being fully charged it dies within hours.I have it completely set up for optimized battery life.I have lost emails and messages that I was in the middle of composing, and the phone just dies.I've been in the middle of important phone calls when the phone dies, simply because I had just fully charged it a few hours before that, and thought I would be fine for hours to come.I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery a week ago, and I was on the phone with my doctors office yesterday about my first post-op appointment, and my phone died in the middle of it.I thought I had HOURS left before the phone would die.Then I had to plug it in, and wait for it to come back alive, so I could call my doctor back and hopefully not wait a half hour after losing my place in line.On top of that is also has issues with the touchscreen being glitchy, and sometimes I have to tap on things several times to get them to work.As I said, I have been an iPhone owner/user since the very first version came out 17 years ago.I've always loved all my iPhones, and I will continue to be an iPhone user for the rest of my life.This is in no way reflection on Apple iPhones whatsoever.They are an amazing and fantastic piece of technology.I think I just got a bad one for the first time in my life.Luckily, I have just checked and I have until November 6th to return this phone, and I WILL be returning it.The problem is, what do I do in the meantime?Am I expected to buy a new one and get that shipped to me, transfer all my information from this phone to the new one, and then return this one?That is extremely hard to do financially!I am actually still paying for this phone on my Amazon Prime American Express card!Or, do I return this phone and wait until the refund has been issued and then buy another phone? Then wait until that is sent to me.I would not have a phone for at least a week in the interim, and we all know these days that's a practical impossibility.I am also having several medical issues.Like I said, I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery last Monday, September 9th, and have several upcoming follow up appointments, and physical therapy appointments.I also have several other non-related medical issues that definitely require that I have a phone.I just don't know what to do.

      "I ordered this phone in excellent condition and it was just THAT !!! Excellent just like as described . Besides a little dent on the bottom corner of the phone which obviously doesn’t interfere with the functionality of the phone , it other wise looks flawless upon unboxing !!! Not a single scratch . Battery life at 98% when I received it (REALLY GOOD BATTERY LIFE) beyond what I was expecting , and charges really fast with charging cable I’ve already had laying around from old previous phones . Had no problem connecting this phone with my courier . Honestly no complaints on my end . For $400 it’s a major steal I am pleased with my purchase from this seller . If you’re thinking about purchasing a phone from this specific seller , do it . Highly recommend you won’t be disappointed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Positive            Positive\n",
      "Good so far. Phones battery healt is at 86%. Phone condition is good, no scratches. Phone seems to be working well. The screen looks great. The only thing I would say makes a difference is that the camera has a little visible wear and tear. I was scared to order as the reviews werent great but im glad I did.

      "Great phone in great condition. Battery health was a bit low at 90% but was in great condition and works well. I had a it of trouble setting up the Apple ID, I upgraded from an IPhone 12. I had previously disconnected my previous line so no longer have the number. Unfortunately the old number was still connected, so every time I would try to use the Apple ID connected to the iPhone 12 it would send a confirmation code to the phone number so I had no way of using the phone number. So I had to create a new Apple ID and email. Other than that everything works fine and I purchased the yellow option and love the phone and the color is cute!💛💛💛                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Positive            Positive\n",
      "After reading other reviews, I decided to go with Amazon Renewed premium. Phone looked like it was new without any scratches or unusual wear. After transferring information from old phone to this one and updated apps, the phone works flawlessly. I found two things wrong and not really wrong, but it did not come with any kind of instructions, and battery life was at 84 percent. I was hoping for higher battery life, but it is what it is. All in all, I'm pretty satisfied with my purchase.

      "I am really, really satisfied with this purchase.  I destroyed my IPhone 15 and I didn’t want to spend all that money for a new one.  I looked all over and this was the best quality for the price I could find!  I took it to Best Buy and it was verified to have all Apple parts.  There was some kind of condensation or something on the inside of the camera lens but it doesn’t seem to interfere with my photos.  I will use these guys again in the future.

      "So far so good…the only thing that bugs me is the fact they can’t warrant the water resistance that a new or apple certified phone would have.Which means it has absolutely  been  worked on (renewed iPhone) by a third party vender ???Had it a few days and it has been fine 90% battery life …charged it last night at around 8:30. 9 oclock it was fully charged and it’s now at 38 % so about 15 hrs.with little to mild use .The camera acts up a little ,as in scanning an id for identity verification.but all around it seems to be performing like an I phone .
